# GEE_RF_simplify
The research of this project is mainly based on the sample data of images collected from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. It integrates Random Forest and RuleCOSI+ for pruning, and ultimately uses simple rule sets to accurately extract the tidal flat boundaries, deepening the understanding of tidal flat classification principles.

Installation
------------
This study first collects sample data of image maps using "GEE sample point extraction." Then, RuleCOSI+ and Random Forest are used to train the sample data for rule simplification. Finally, the "Application of concise rules on the GEE platform" successfully and accurately identifies the tidal flat boundaries.
